# The Witcher series
My favourite character is Gerald of Riva.
He is a witcher and kills beasts.
He also searches for a girl named Cirilla.
## Charachter traits
* kills monsters an beasts
* searches for Cirilla
* loves potions
* in love with Yennefer
* has two swords, silver and metal

As Gerald said:
> Damn, You're Ugly.
> I Believe In The Sword.
